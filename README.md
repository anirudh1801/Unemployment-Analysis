# Unemployment-Analysis
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing unemployment trends using Python. The project aims to study unemployment rates as a percentage of the labor force, with an emphasis on changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis provides insights into the economic impact of the pandemic and the factors influencing unemployment rates.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes:
- Unemployment Rate (%): The percentage of unemployed individuals in the total labor force.
- Demographic Data: Information such as age groups, gender, and regions,etc.
- Time Period: Covers the period before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze trends over time.

# Task Overview
- Objective: Analyze the unemployment rate and its variations during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Approach: Perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to extract insights from the dataset.
- Tools: Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

# Steps Involved
1. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset containing unemployment rates and related demographic data.
2. Preprocess the Data: Handle missing values, normalize the data, and prepare it for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
   - Identify trends and patterns in unemployment rates.
   - Analyze differences across demographic factors like age, gender, and region.
4. Visualize Data: 
   - Create visualizations like line charts, bar plots, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.
   - Highlight key trends, such as the spike in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. Insights and Conclusions: Summarize the findings and propose potential solutions or policy recommendations to mitigate unemployment.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the code interactively)
